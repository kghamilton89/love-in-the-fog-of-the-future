### Chapter One

When Jerry stepped outside on that memorable morning, he immediately felt that something had happened to him which as a result left him in a state of utter mental dysfunction.

Upset by the realization, he felt a panic coming on. A panic!

Such sensations had become almost unknown to humanity since the supreme administration of the Great Republic was concentrated in The Council of World Intelligence, which, having completely rebuilt life itself, had achieved complete harmony between inner experiences and external the actions of mankind. Since the discovery of the Ultra-Ramsey ray had created the ability to photograph even the most intimate of thoughts, all subconscious impulses, the sense of "I" within each individual was at last brought under the strictest control. Suffice to say, the results of this discovery were monumental.

Criminals no longer existed, since their crimes were detected even before they could be committed, and
mankind was at last freed from all things evil and criminal, at last drunk with brotherly love, with an enthusiasm which brought forth grand results under the auspices of perpetual self-improvement.

After just a few short generations, mankind had reached the peak of prosperity. A number of inventions of a public nature, reasonably used, likened the earthly existence of Mankind to that of the ancient biblical legend: "Heaven on Earth." At last, complete harmony reigned supreme. A detailed study of the impulses of the subconscious "I", as actor and agent, and its individual representatives, had created the opportunity to finally establish an objective World Truth, which was taken as the basis for the creation of the Laws of the World Truth. To support their minimal needs people worked a mere hour per week. And this work, both generalized and logical furnished, or as it were, enabled, the continuation of that eternal holiday in which humanity at last found itself. In the modern era, the fear of a leisured and idle existence which had consumed men of the past millennium had been resolutely eliminated, humanity had been perfected.

As such, Jerry was alarmed, and vaguely hypothesized about how to handle the current situation. Five days ago, feeling similar to how he felt at present, he had gone to the Palace of Great Knowledge, but now Jerry suddenly founded himself in a state which merited a different remedy.
