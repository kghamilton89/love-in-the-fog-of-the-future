### Chapter One

When Jerry stepped outside on that memorable morning, he immediately felt that something had occurred which as a result left him in a state of utter mental dysfunction.

Upset by the realization, he felt a panic coming on. A panic!

Such sensations had become almost unknown to humanity since the administration of the Great Republic was concentrated in The Council of World Intelligence, which, having completely rebuilt life itself, had achieved complete harmony between the inner thoughts and external actions of mankind. Since the discovery of the Ultra-Ramsey ray had created the ability to photograph even the most intimate of thoughts, all subconscious impulses, the sense of "I" within each individual was at long last brought under the strictest control. Suffice to say, the results of this discovery were monumental.

Criminals no longer existed, since their crimes were detected even before they could be committed, and
mankind was at last freed from all things evil and criminal, at last drunk with a brotherly love, an enthusiasm which brought forth grand results under the auspices of perpetual self-improvement.

After just a few short generations, mankind had reached the peak of its prosperity. A number of inventions for the public good had appeared and likened the earthly existence of Mankind to that of ancient biblical legend: "Heaven on Earth." At last, complete harmony reigned supreme. A detailed study of the impulses of the subconscious "I", as actor and agent, and its individual representatives, had created the opportunity to finally establish an objective World Truth, which was taken as the basis for the creation of the Laws of World Truth. To support their few remaining needs people worked a mere hour per week. And this work, both general and logical, furnished or as it were enabled, the continuation of that eternal holiday on which humanity had at last found itself. In the modern era, the fear of a leisured and idle existence which had consumed men of the past millennium had been resolutely eliminated, humanity had been perfected.

As such, Jerry was alarmed and vaguely hypothesized about how to handle the current situation. Five days ago, travelling the same route as he was today, on the way to the Palace of Great Knowledge, Jerry suddenly found himself in an unfamiliar situation. Scarcely had he stepped onto a nearby moving platform when the slender figure of a young girl appeared on the platform of a neighboring home. Apparently in a hurry, she attempted to leap over the portion of the moving sidewalk traveling in the opposing direction. Her leap was indeed full of the virility of youth, but as her right leg landed next to Jerry, the left slipped and landed on the opposing platform. The poor girl would have invariably fallen had Jerry not grabbed her by the waist and set her down beside him. Free of his momentary embrace, she threw him a grateful look, and at that very moment Jerry felt that first fit of sweet excitement. For the remainder of their time together on the moving platform they chatted with one another quite cheerfully.

"Her name is Donny and she's going to the exhibition of cult objects from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. She's on her way there now to write a short report. In fact, she was very much in a hurry. Would the fall have hurt? Oh no! You know, the platform is actually quite soft. Besides that, accidents are completely non-existent in the City of Reason. Nevertheless, she was very grateful. Thanks to him, she managed to save a few extra seconds picking herself up."

When the street upon which they were traveling at last reach the Museum of Mankind,
where Donny's exhibition was on display, they nodded their heads towards one another and Donny extended her arm to thank him once more. Jerry took her by the hand and Donny gave his arm a strong shaking. Jerry felt dimly aware of the absolute absurdity of this act. This ancient gesture seemed right out of the sixteenth century. With that, they parted. Having reached the platform of the Palace of Great Knowledge, Jerry travelled under one of the psycho-control boards scattered in
large numbers throughout the city. Here he was first convinced that his
internal balance was somewhat disturbed: the approaching control apparatus gave a slight crackle and momentary flash but the phenomenon was so fleeting, that no one paid it any attention; even the Public Security Service official monitoring the checkpoint did not deem it worthy to pursue the matter any further than a quick look up and down.

After this first chance meeting, they continued to meet with one another each day. Jerry suddenly discovered within himself the greatest of interests in all the minutia of the religious fanaticism which affected the people of the twenty-first century. Naturally, the answers to his newfound questions could be gleaned most readily in the Museum of Mankind, where he ventured
daily and under Donny's direct supervision, studied the utter horrors of Christian penance. While considering the hood of some monastic order he marveled at its utter dissimilarity to the epitrachelion vestments of the clergymen.

Thus, four days passed.

During this time, Jerry, using the artificially heightened memory his contemporaries had worked so dutifully to cultivate, he collected within himself the complete history of religion, from prehistoric times to the twenty first century, when a chance brilliant discovery in the field of biology, specifically the artificial cultivation of the living cell made man the Creator of Nature. From then on, the beautiful legend of God was destroyed forever and henceforth never reborn.

Of course, once he had completed his studied there was really no need for Jerry to return to the museum, and his presence in the Museum of Mankind on the fifth day might have surprised anyone else,
but not Donny. She smiled at him no less affectionately than the day before, and then, whilst bending over looking for some details among the religious rags, their lips suddenly come together in a passionate kiss. Most likely it would have last a bit longer had all the rustling in the control apparatus not startled them, causing them to break apart. Suddenly a sharp noise from within the device caused it to malfunction.

They were saved.

However, this strange noise had also aroused the attention of the Servant of Public Security. Hiding themselves, Jerry and Donny heard him approach the apparatus, which hung helplessly with its vibrating tentacles. He bent over and produced his wireless phone:

"Another one with damage to the control device. We need a replacement."

A few seconds later the device answered:

"An order has been given to replace all weak voltage devices with stronger ones. It will be done tomorrow. In the Name of Public Security!

Exercise caution!"

And with that, Jerry and Donny were spared from the trouble of being seized from communicating with humanity for violating the elementary laws of the Great Republic "On the inadmissibility of an illegitimate kiss" and for manifestations of danger for the resultant imbalances caused by their actions. Apparently, in the City of Reason, luck was still possible.

They looked at one another and smiled

That night, Jerry could do nothing but dream of Donny. His imagination reproduced every gesture and every smile, he could hear the beautiful texture of her voice in the very depths of his soul. Waking from his hallucinations the following morning, he asked himself with horror: "What is going to become of me?" A vague burning sensation came upon him from head to foot and rendered him completely unable to think of anyone or anything. There was only Donny. He felt empty of the competence and clarity which usually possessed his mind. All around him, reality seemed to lose its importance and he felt filled with a wild ecstasy. He wanted to sing and scream and lose himself in the wild dances of the ancients, but of course this was all strictly forbidden in the City of Reason. He suddenly felt compelled to rush into the streets and throw his arms around the first person he encountered, but he was able to control himself.

Thoughtfully stepping onto the platform in front of his home, Jerry looked out upon the softly
moving sidewalks. Dressed in weightless clothes with no seams, bathed in purple rays, breathable, yet still carrying the aroma of a single man, Jerry was no different from any typical bachelor of the forty sixth century. In his all white outfit, with its flowing beautiful folds, and wearing
an impenetrable mask of tranquility upon his face, he truly seemed the embodiment
of civil equilibrium. Only once did the shadow of horror flash across his
face. It was only then, when by chance while glancing at his feet, that Jerry noticed the moving ray of the Ramsey apparatus. He jumped back, frightened. The beam, just missing him, settled upon a man nearby revealing the highly scientific inner thoughts of this venerable citizen. The man looked at Jerry in surprise. In the City of Reason it was not customary to hide one's thoughts from the Ultra Ramsey
rays. In order to disguise his involuntary reaction Jerry turned away and reached out to the nearby shelf, whereupon there lay a little compartments containing each citizens Daily Caloric Portion pills. He mechanically took his assigned pill and swallowed. To his horror, he felt himself unable to prevent the following action whereby he again reached towards the shelf and took another citizen's assigned pill and again he mechanically swallowed. Besides the natural imbalances he had now created in his system, Jerry had now become a thief.

Knowing full well that tomorrow he was scheduled to undergo a detailed thought reading from the Ramsey Apparatus and that soon enough it would all be out in the open: the illegitimate kiss, the theft, everything.

"How nice it would be," Jerry thought unhappily, "if people never had to produce a report of their thoughts as we do today."

"However," Jerry caught himself, "people are unable to truly unable control what surfaces in their consciousness." Convinced that to continue on his spree made no sense, Jerry decided to cease his criminal activity, and at the very least see Donny today. "What will be will be," he recalled the long-forgotten proverb and, in the heat of despair, rushed along the moving street.

From that moment, a flurry of events began to unfold with dizzying speed. As soon as the street turned around the nearest corner, Jerry passed through a checkpoint of the psycho-control board. Upon doing so, the inexpressibly awful occurred. The gauge reading the presence of a criminal unbalance shot to an unprecedented level. Vibrating tentacles made an extraordinary leap to the top and, emitting a glowing stream of air, formed a radiant halo above Jerry's head, reminiscent of the radiance
of some ancient Christian martyr. There was a sharp sound, which was so powerful several people nearby fell to the floor. An old man, obviously not from the first rejuvination, convulsively jerked his legs trying to blow air through his ears and restore the disturbed auditory balance.
Street traffic stopped. The Servant of Public
Security on duty came towards Jerry and put his hand up Jerry's shoulder, inviting him to follow.

Jeri obeyed in silence.
