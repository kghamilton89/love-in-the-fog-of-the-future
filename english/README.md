### Chapter One

When Jerry stepped outside on that memorable morning, he immediately felt that something had occurred which as a result left him in a state of utter mental dysfunction.

Upset by the realization, he felt a panic coming on. A panic!

Such sensations had become almost unknown to humanity since the administration of the Great Republic was concentrated in The Council of World Intelligence, which, having completely rebuilt life itself, had achieved complete harmony between the inner thoughts and external actions of mankind. Since the discovery of the Ultra-Ramsey ray had created the ability to photograph even the most intimate of thoughts, all subconscious impulses, the sense of "I" within each individual was at long last brought under the strictest control. Suffice to say, the results of this discovery were monumental.

Criminals no longer existed, since their crimes were detected even before they could be committed, and
mankind was at last freed from all things evil and criminal, at last drunk with a brotherly love, an enthusiasm which brought forth grand results under the auspices of perpetual self-improvement.

After just a few short generations, mankind had reached the peak of its prosperity. A number of inventions for the public good had appeared and likened the earthly existence of Mankind to that of ancient biblical legend: "Heaven on Earth." At last, complete harmony reigned supreme. A detailed study of the impulses of the subconscious "I", as actor and agent, and its individual representatives, had created the opportunity to finally establish an objective World Truth, which was taken as the basis for the creation of the Laws of World Truth. To support their few remaining needs people worked a mere hour per week. And this work, both general and logical, furnished or as it were enabled, the continuation of that eternal holiday on which humanity had at last found itself. In the modern era, the fear of a leisured and idle existence which had consumed men of the past millennium had been resolutely eliminated, humanity had been perfected.

As such, Jerry was alarmed and vaguely hypothesized about how to handle the current situation. Five days ago, travelling the same route as he was today, on the way to the Palace of Great Knowledge, Jeri suddenly found himself in an unfamiliar situation. Scarcely had he stepped onto a nearby moving platform when the slender figure of a young girl appeared on the platform of a neighboring home. Apparently in a hurry, she attempted to leap over the portion of the moving sidewalk traveling in the opposing direction. Her leap was indeed full of the virility of youth, but as her right leg landed next to Jerry, the left slipped and landed on the opposing platform. The poor girl would have invariably fallen had Jerry not grabbed her by the waist and set her down beside him. Free of his momentary embrace, she threw him a grateful look, and at that very moment Jerry felt that first fit of sweet excitement. For the remainder of their time together on the moving platform they chatted with one another quite cheerfully.

"Her name is Donny and she's going to the exhibition of cult objects from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. She's on her way there now to write a short report. In fact, she was very much in a hurry. Would the fall have hurt? Oh no! You know, the platform is actually quite soft. Besides that, accidents are completely non-existent in the City of Reason. Nevertheless, she was very grateful. Thanks to him, she managed to save a few extra seconds picking herself up."

When the street upon which they were traveling at last reach the Museum of Mankind,
where Donny's exhibition was on display, they nodded their heads towards one another and Donny extended her arm to thank him once more. Jerry took her by the hand and Donny gave his arm a strong shaking. Jerry felt dimly aware of the absolute absurdity of this act. This ancient gesture seemed right out of the sixteenth century. With that, they parted. Having reached the platform of the Palace of Great Knowledge, Jerry travelled under one of the psycho-control boards scattered in
large numbers throughout the city. Here he was first convinced that his
internal balance was somewhat disturbed: the approaching control apparatus gave a slight crackle and momentary flash but the phenomenon was so fleeting, that no one paid it any attention; even the Public Security Service official monitoring the checkpoint did not deem it worthy to pursue the matter any further than a quick look up and down.

After this first meeting happened by chance, they continued to meet with one another every day. Jeri suddenly discovered within himself the greatest of interests in all the minutia of the religious fanaticism that affected the people of the twenty-first century.
