### Chapter One

When Jerry stepped outside on that fated morning, he immediately understood that something with him wasn't quite right and it disturbed his usual peace of mind.

Upon the realization of this disturbance, Jerry began to become worried. Can you imagine it?

Worry was a state almost unknown to the People since the power of the Great Republic was concentrated into the hands of the Council of World Reason, which, having rebuilt life upon completely new principles, had achieved complete harmony between the internal and external states of mankind. Since the discovery of Ultraramsian Rays, which made it possible to photograph a person's most intimate thoughts, all impulses of the subconscious, the "I" of each individual, had been brought under complete control. The results of this event were colossal.

Criminals no longer existed, since crimes were discovered before they were committed, and humanity, freed from everything evil and illegal, intoxicated with brotherly love, enthusiastically devoted itself to fruitful work within the framework of self-improvement.

After just a few generations, the People reached the pinnacle of prosperity. A whole series of inventions of social innovations, wisely used, rendered earthly existence of the People to level of the biblical story of Genesis. Universal harmony reigned supreme. A detailed study of the subconscious, as belonging to the group and the individual, allowed for the creation of an objective truth, upon the foundation of which the "Laws of Objective Reason" were created. To meet their basic needs, people were required to work only one hour a week. And this work was, as it were, a continuation of that eternal holiday in which humanity was plunged. By this time, the fear of an idle existence, which so clearly characterized people of the past millennia, had been completely eliminated; humanity had perfected its expression of reasonable pleasure.
