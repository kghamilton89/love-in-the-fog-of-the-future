### Chapter One

When Jerry stepped outside on that fated morning, he immediately understood that something with him wasn't quite right and it disturbed his usual peace of mind.

Upon the realization of this peculiar disturbance, Jerry began to become worried. Can you imagine it?

Worry was a state almost unknown to the People since the power of the Great Republic was concentrated into the hands of the Council of World Reason, which, having rebuilt life upon completely new principles, had achieved complete harmony between the internal and external states of mankind. Since the discovery of Ultraramsian Rays, which made it possible to photograph a person's most intimate thoughts, all impulses of the subconscious, the "I" of each individual, had been brought under complete control. The results of this event were colossal.

Criminals no longer existed, since crimes were discovered before they were committed, and humanity, freed from everything evil and illegal, and utterly intoxicated with brotherly love, enthusiastically devoted itself to fruitful work within the framework of self-improvement.

After just a few generations, the People reached the pinnacle of human prosperity. A whole series of inventions and social innovations, wisely used, rendered the earthly existence of the People to level of the biblical story of Genesis. Universal harmony reigned supreme. A detailed study of the subconscious, as belonging to both the group and the individual, allowed for the creation of an objective truth, upon the foundation of which the Laws of Objective Reason were created. To meet their basic needs, people were required to work only a single hour each week. And this work was, as it were, a continuation of that eternal holiday into which humanity had found itself plunged. By this time, the fear of an idle existence, which had so clearly characterized people of the past millennia, had been completely eliminated; humanity had perfected its expression of any and all reasonable pleasures.

As such, Jerry was excited, even if only vaguely aware of what was going to happen next. Five days ago, whilst preparing to head to the Palace of Great Knowledge as he did today and each day, Jerry suddenly found himself in an unusual situation. As soon as he stepped onto the moving sidewalk, the slender figure of a young girl appeared on the platform of a neighboring house. Apparently in a hurry, she decided at once to leap over that part of the street that was moving in the opposite direction. The jump was full of an abundance of youthful vigor, but while her right foot landed cleanly beside Jerry, her left one slipped and touched the opposing strip of sidewalk. The girl would have inevitably fallen if Jerry had not grabbed her by the waist and placed her soundly next to him. Freeing herself from his embrace, she threw him a grateful glance, and it was in that moment that Jerry felt the first twinge of that sweet excitement. To his content, the two of them chatted happily the rest of the way.

Her name is Doni. She is going to an exhibition of religious objects of people of the 20th and 21st centuries. She is giving a short presentation on the topic, in fact. She was in a hurry. But you could have been hurt! Oh, not at all! The road is so soft! Besides, accidents are completely absent in the City of Reason. But still, she is very grateful to him. Thanks to his friendly help, she managed to save a few moments on her harried commute.

As the street upon which they were travelling reached the Museum of Humanity, where Doni's exhibition was located, they nodded their heads to one another, and she extended her hand to him, thanking him with this unfamiliar gesture, and Jerry, taking it, shook it in a firm handshake, vaguely aware of the absurdity of this entire situation. This anachronistic handshake, as he knew it be called, in the 46th century seemed to throw them both back into ancient times together. After this exchange, they separated. Arriving at his destination and standing on the platform of the Palace of Great Knowledge, Jerry fell under the influence of one of the psycho-controlled boards scattered in large numbers throughout the city. Here he became convinced for the first time that his own implementation was somewhat disrupted: the control apparatus, as he approached, instantly made a slight crackling sound. But the phenomenon was so fleeting that no one paid attention to it; even the Servant of Public Safety at his post simply limited himself to one searching glance towards Jerry.

After their first meeting, it somehow happened that they continued to meet each day. Jerry suddenly discovered in himself the greatest interest in all the details of religious fanaticism, the latest outbreak of which engulfed the people of the 21st century. Naturally, he could most readily get an answer to his requests in the Museum of Humanity, where he went daily each morning and where, under Doni's direct supervision, he comprehended the full horror of Christian penance, and examining the hood of any monastic order, he got a real idea of its complete dissimilarity with the epitrachelion in the vestments of a clergyman.

Thus passed four days.

During this time Jerry, with that artificially mind memory of his, constantly cultivated by his contemporaries and which he had already mastered perfectly, gained a complete understanding of the history of the gradual development of religious beliefs, starting from prehistoric times and ending in the 21st century, when a brilliant discovery in the field of the biology of artificial cultivation of a living cell made man the Creator of Nature. From that moment on, the naive God myth was destroyed once and for all, never to be revived again.

Jerry had learned this all very well over the course of four days, and his next appearance at the Museum of Humanity on the fifth day might have surprised anyone, but not Doni. She smiled at him no less affectionately than the day before, and then, when they hunched over in order to search some details amongst the religious parchment of which she was a specialist, their lips suddenly touched in a sudden and wholly intoxicating kiss. It probably would have lasted a little longer if the ever-increasing rustle in the control apparatus had not made them jump away from each other in fright. Suddenly the noise stopped. The device had overheated and failed, unable to withstand the tension of their passion.

They were saved.

Nevertheless, even that noise so vaguely detected by the device still attracted the attention of the Servant of Public Safety. Jerry and Doni, who found themselves hiding now, could hear him, first approaching the damaged device with its vibrating tentacles hanging helplessly, then bending over the wireless phone and throwing it into space:

"Damage to the low-voltage control device has been detected! A replacement is needed."

And a few seconds later, the room answered him:

"An order has been issued to replace all low-voltage devices with stronger ones. It will be completed tomorrow. In The Name Of Public Safety! Be vigilant!"

Thus, Jerry and Doni were saved from the trouble of being excluded from communication with humanity for violating the elementary laws of the Great Republic on the Inadmissibility of Extramarital Kissing and for showing dangerous instability in their actions towards others. Apparently, even in the City of Reason, happy accidents were still possible.

Jerry and Doni smiled cheerfully at each other. 

Jerry spent the entire night that followed in a dreamlike state, fantacizing about Doni. He went over in his imagination her every gesture, her every smile, listening to the sweet tones of her voice sounding somewhere in the depths of his soul. Waking up in the morning of his pleasant dreams, he asked himself with horror: "What is happening to me?" Some vague, elusive process of unbearable burning gripped him from head to toe and, taking over all his thoughts, forcing him to think only about Doni. It deprived his brain functions of their inherent sobriety and clarity of thinking. All the objects around him seemed to have lost half of their reality, were obscured by a haze of spirituality and filled Jerry with wild and ecstatic delight by their very appearance. He wanted to sing, shout, and, making a noise unacceptable in the City of Reason, indulge in the wild dances of ancient peoples. He was able, under the influence of an all-consuming joy, to throw himself on the neck of the first person he met and, in a wild rush of embraces, give vent to his feelings. However, Jerry did not do any of this.

Pausing thoughtfully on the platform of his house, he looked at the gently moving street lanes. Dressed in weightless clothes without seams, having just undergone chemical bathing in purple rays, breathing the scent of a bachelor man, Jerry was no different from a typical bachelor of the XLVI century. In his snow-white clothes, flowing in beautiful folds, with an impenetrable mask of calm on his face, he seemed the epitome of civic balance. Only once did a shadow of horror flicker across his face. It was when, accidentally looking down at his feet, Jerry saw the sliding beam of the Ramsov apparatus. He jumped back in fright and the beam, without touching him, stopped at his neighbor, revealing some highly scientific reflections of this venerable citizen. The man looked at Jerry in surprise. In the City of Reason, it was not customary to hide one's thoughts from the ultra-Rams rays. Jerry, in order to disguise his involuntary movement, turned around in confusion and, seeing a box with a "daily portion of calories" on the wall, went up to it, took a pill and put it in his mouth, mechanically swallowed. It was only after that that he realized the horror of his act. He had swallowed the second daily portion of food that did not belong to him today, and thus, not to mention any complications that might arise in his body, he was becoming a thief.

At the same time, the next day he would have another revelation about his thoughts over the past week in front of the Brahms apparatus. Then everything will be revealed: both the "extramarital kiss" and its theft.

"How nice it would be," the unfortunate man thought, "if people, having done something, would never have realized in their minds that they had done it."

However, Jerry caught himself, "People cannot perceive what reaches their consciousness." And then, having made sure that to keep thinking is to pile up one accusation after another against himself, Jerry decided to give up on everything and at least see Doni today. "Come what may," he remembered a long-forgotten proverb and, in the heat of despair, rushed into the moving street.

Further events began to unfold with dizzying speed. As soon as the street turned the nearest corner, Jerry fell under the influence of a psychocontrol board. And it was here that something inexpressibly terrible happened. The pressure in the scale of criminal imbalance showed an unprecedented height, noting the appearance of a criminally unbalanced element in the sphere of its influence. The vibrating tentacles made an extraordinary leap upward and, emitting a luminous stream of air, formed a radiant halo above Jerry's head, like the radiance of the ancient Christian martyrs. A sharp bell rang, so unusual to the auditory perception of others that they fell to the ground in horror. Some old man, not the first rejuvenation, convulsively kicked his legs, trying to restore the disturbed auditory balance by passing air through his ears, Street traffic stopped. A Public Security Servant approached Jerry and, putting his hand on his shoulder, motioned for him to follow him.

Jerry obeyed in silence.

### Chapter Two

Jerry sat in the pre-trial chamber and tried not to think about anything, knowing that all his thoughts were absorbed by the walls with the brightness of a kaleidoscope. He was not very good at this, especially since the Liragam rays began to penetrate him from everywhere, completely harmless, but having the property of stimulating the activity of the brain functions of the human body. Apparently, the Council of World Reason, whose verdict he was about to hear, decided to familiarize himself in detail with the inner contents of the accused.

Thinking about it, Jerry came to a conclusion that was very passive and very difficult to convey: something between the expression of the ancient Russians "to hell with them" and "God be with them." Perhaps something approaching more closely to the first concept of "to hell with them", because, after all, after all the horrors he had experienced, Jerry felt like a rather notorious scoundrel and therefore was inclined to maintain a spirit of indignation. Under the influence of the same damned Liragam rays, he had to mentally return to his early childhood, revealing, among other things, an incident that he seemed to have completely forgotten. Raised like all the children of the City of Reason, he only knew about his parents that they were a man and a woman. Subsequently, he learned some more details related to the identity of his father and mother, but since this happened under rather unpleasant circumstances, Jerry tried to stop thinking about it as soon as possible. Nevertheless, he had to recall all the details. Once, already as a conscious teenager, he showed unheard-of disobedience towards one of his teachers: the fact was so extraordinary that it reached the Council of World Reason. A detailed scientific examination was carried out, both of Jerry himself and his parents, as a result of which It turned out that although Jerry's father and his mother were individually quite balanced people, but the potential of the spiritual power of a man many times exceeded the potential of a woman, which resulted in an imbalance in the character of the child. The marriage was immediately dissolved. Both were given their virginity back, but a mistake occurred and the result of this mistake was Jerry. Science has been working for a long time to balance Jerry's spiritual world. New elements were artificially introduced. they balanced, slowly changing the essence of Jerry's "I". Now, remembering all this, Jerry had to record very unpleasant details related to these modifications: everything was done on him, up to standing for hours under the apparatus, which systematically introduced into his consciousness elementary concepts "about the need for reasonable obedience." Then his thoughts returned to Doni. and, no longer owning either them or himself, he began to run around the preliminary test chamber, thereby giving exhaustive material for observation.

### Chapter Three

The interrogation ended completely unexpectedly. The walls, of which Jerry had such a bad opinion, suddenly parted and, gliding silently, gradually disappeared into the distance. Jerry was in the sentencing hall. As soon as he looked up, he immediately felt completely helpless. The hall was a huge circular area, several kilometers in circumference, with opaque smooth walls inclined to the middle and forming a colossal vault overhead. Now Jerry had to experience the full weight of emptiness. Not a single object caught the eye. The only line he could catch was the line of intersection between the wall and the floor, giving the impression of a properly closed circle. When Jerry, with his head thrown back, looked straight up, he could barely catch a merging point at a great height above him, where all these gray walls closed in their terrible monotony. The judges were somewhere high above him. They probably saw him so small and pathetic in the midst of the emptiness surrounding him. He was waiting for the verdict. I craved it! But everything remained infinitely silent. To give himself courage, Jerry stretched out his hand, spreading his fingers and trying to find comfort for his gaze in the variety of their outlines. But the background for them was still terribly monotonous. The criminal, no matter how great his crime, felt his insignificance in front of this overwhelming gray void. It was Eternity itself, really embodied.

Jerry ventured to speak:

"I'm here!" He timidly declared into space, and his timid statement, repeated in a hundred-voiced echo, reached the ears of the judges, in the form of a whispered request.

Then the heavens opened. A voice from above was saying:

"The Council of World Reason, having examined your thoughts, has made sure that your body has lost the balance necessary to communicate with humanity."

At the first words of that terrible voice, repeated by the walls in countless intonations, Jerry knelt down powerlessly, trying to cover his ears with his hands. The gesture is eternally eloquent. But here he did not achieve his goal. The sounds grew, expanded, and, touching the auditory organs, penetrated into consciousness.

The voice from above continued:

"An additional analysis of the state of your body indicates increased nervousness, exceeding all the limits set in our time. The reason for this is your excessive puberty. If you do not voluntarily agree to marry, the Council of World Reason will be forced to isolate you from the rest of humanity, bearing in mind your psychological imbalance. In The Name Of The Public Good! Answer me!"

By nature, Jerry was not, in fact, a pessimist, but such an unexpected conclusion of the verdict exceeded his most optimistic hopes. In a fit of grateful delight, he jumped to his feet and, stretching out his arms, exclaimed:

"You make me the happiest of people! Oh, dear Doni, how good it will be for us!"

A voice from above interrupted him:

"Calm down, don't make noise: excessive noise will only bring you suffering; You should know that everything related to the birth and upbringing of the future generation is under the direct jurisdiction of the Council of Public Welfare; no marriage can be concluded without its sanction; and meanwhile it is established that Doni and you, according to your own according to the psychophysical outlines of your inner life, you are completely unsuitable for each other; this circumstance makes your marriage impossible."

Jerry's sprawled body remained silent for several moments. Then a groan of inhuman agony, vibrating plaintively in the air, rose up.

The voice continued:

"You don't realize how great the power of your passion is. There are only a few women in the entire space of the Great Republic who are able to organically recognize you. The one who is destined to be your wife lives on the 6C-D Russian Lowlands. You will have to fly across the ocean. You'll see her tomorrow. Your psychophysical potentials are almost identical. The offspring will be quite balanced."

A cry of wild animal pain shook the air. Jerry ran, not remembering himself, sobbing and laughing at the same time. When he reached the nearest wall, he threw himself on the ground in exhaustion.

The voice from above continued:

"No noise. You might think that you are a man of the XX century. Don't worry. It's inevitable. You will be accompanied to the projectile by a Public Security Servant. When you fly over the ocean, you will be met by another one. He will have all the instructions. Answer me, do you agree?."

Jerry gritted his teeth. The words of supplication were asking for heaven. But he knew that by his silence he was throwing an unheard-of protest against the existing laws of "World Truth." And he was silent, because at that moment, thanks to the unequal marriage of his parents, the male will prevailed in him.

And in response to this challenge, a voice from above thundered:

"The laws of World Truth are unshakable. The Truth is in the Mind! Accustom yourself to this thought. The Truth is in the Mind!"

The hundred-voiced echo picked up in different ways:

"The truth is in the Mind! The Truth is in the Mind! The Truth is in the Mind!"

A wild sight for the XLVI century was represented by this man with an insanely distorted face, running away from himself in the midst of a gray void without beginning and without end.

"The truth is in the Mind!" sounded somewhere inside him, fell from somewhere above and, hitting the brain, bounced against the walls, streaking them with zigzag lines: "The truth is in the Mind!"

Now the very air seemed to glow: "The truth is in the Mind! The Truth is in the Mind!"

A fiery tornado circled and engulfed the unfortunate man.

To the question: "Are you ready?" Jhary could only mumble an inarticulate, "yes."

His will was broken.

### Chapter Four

As he approached the projectile with the Servant of Public Safety, Jerry was mentally aware of everything that had happened. It was all over for him. He couldn't fight against what was inevitable. The consciousness of his powerlessness and the unusual smell of an already married man drove him into a quiet frenzy. He was ready to bite himself and others. He recalled with disgust the circumstances under which he, still an unmarried bachelor, was vaccinated with a "married smell". The chemical composition of the "Room" artificially introduced into his body produced a reaction, making him forever a married man in the eyes of others. With the strictness of morals that prevailed among his contemporaries, Jerry could consider himself quite guaranteed that he would never have to cheat with anyone. A small but very solid precaution on the part of the Council of World Reason! Jerry remembered with an ironic half-smile how in ancient times the same duties were performed by small, easily removable wedding rings. The naive but happy childhood of mankind!

As they approached the projectile, Jerry wanted to know some details of the upcoming trip. The servant of Public Safety kindly satisfied his curiosity.

“Yes. He will fly completely alone, since the imbalance of his internal impulses poses a known danger to the rest of the passengers. What? Was this the first time he had to use a projectile? After all, this is a common way of traveling a long distance. That's right. The projectile is designed according to the principle of weightlessness. No, it is unnecessary for him to get acquainted with the mechanism. Everything will happen by itself. After the exit door is hermetically closed, the projectile will receive a boost and direction from the Anirin explosion. Silent explosions will continue in the back of the projectile, periodically, throughout the entire journey. He will have to stay on the road for three hours. When the Magnetic Platform 6C-D of the Russian Lowland attracts a projectile, a Servant of Public Safety will open the door to it. He will have further instructions. Have a good trip. Oh no! Everything related to the projectile, from the distance to the discharge force of the Anirin, is mathematically calculated correctly. There has not been a single accident in the last millennium. Be calm!"

The exit door hermetically slammed shut behind the Public Security Servant, and almost immediately Jerry felt two jolts. The first one, light, barely perceptible, is under your feet: This is the projectile moving on its way. The second one, strong, shouting loudly with joy, was in the place where Jerry was groping for his heart: in front of him, in an open niche of the next room, stood his charming Doni.

The first moments passed in silent delight. Two pairs of eyes devoured each other in love ecstasy. Then, in a wild outburst of love, their owners found themselves in the arms of another.

Three hours flew by like a wonderful dream. Kisses. Hugs. The words, full of alluring tenderness, alternated with the precision of Anirin's work. Caresses are sometimes noisier than the silent action of this explosive.

"How silly he is! What audacity to think that she had forgotten him. No, she found out about everything from the evening light messages of the Council of World Reason. Against the background of the night sky, she read about the discovery of a man with unusually criminal tendencies. It was he, her dear Jerry, who had criminal tendencies. There she also found out that he was being sent to the 6C-D of the Russian Lowlands to get married. Oh, she couldn't let that happen! She managed to sneak into the shell and hide there until its departure. That's how they ended up together. How happy she is!"

Imagining the Council of World Reason in its radiance of infallibility, they couldn't help but laugh.

Love has made their spirit capable of rebellion.

The only time the delight of the wedding night was overshadowed by a small unpleasant incident. Donne, caressing her lover's skin with her lips, suddenly felt an unfamiliar smell. After sniffing, she was convinced that it was "the smell of a married man." She jumped away from Jerry in horror.

"Are you really married already?"

Jerry began to talk in detail and convincingly about the reasons for such a premature phenomenon. But before he had finished, an unusually long kiss deprived him of the opportunity to continue his narrative, thereby destroying, this time unsuccessful, the event of the Council of World Reason.

### Chapter Five

Among the millions of happy humanity who believed that "Truth is in the Mind," at the memorable hour of the arrival of the projectile, there was one person who did not at all suspect what a severe moral ordeal he would now have to undergo. It was a Servant of Public Safety 6C-D of the Russian Lowlands.

When he opened the shell door to let Jerry out, he didn't think about it at all.

Having discovered the annoying fact of the presence of a woman, about whom not a word was said in the instructions of the Council of World Reason, the Servant of Public Security decided not to notice the woman.

Probably, any other Servant of Public Safety would have done the same in his place.

But the man did not go without the woman. And when the invitations from the Servant of Public Security became more insistent, he loudly announced that his name was Jerry and that this woman was his wife and her name was Doni.

Since cases of lying were very rare in the Republic of the World Mind, the Servant of Public Safety was put in an unusually ambiguous position by this statement. He had instructions from the Council of World Reason, which clearly stated that a single man with a married scent would arrive. He should have been taken to the woman "who should be his wife." Recalling this order, the Servant of Public Safety doubted even the ability of his reproductive brain functions. He doubted to such an extent that he went to the nearest control unit and arranged a self-check. But no!.. The results were brilliant. The brain functions worked with the precision of a film recorder. Then, here, with the help of the same control board, he put Jerry and Doni to the test, and was convinced of the undoubted fact of their marriage. The heat of their unknown love enveloped them in a blue haze of happiness. Outrageously clear, visible almost to the naked eye.

The servant of Public Safety felt an inner thrill. Brought up with a strictly instilled consciousness of the possibility of only monogamy in the Great Republic of the World Mind, he now trembled before the contradiction that had opened up. But the directives of the Council of World Reason were, as always, so definite that he did not dare to disobey them.

Nevertheless, his entire body was shaken to the core. How!.. He, a Servant of Public Safety, suddenly leads a man, obviously married, to a woman "who should become his wife."

During the entire journey, while the three of them, in a separate group, stood on the moving street, the Servant of Public Security did not utter a word. At times, he felt weak in his legs from the excess of contradictions that worried him. Arriving at the place, they saw that they were already expected. The woman "who was to become his wife" was quite prepared to meet the man "who was to become her husband." She was even warned about her fiance's prematurely married scent. But she was not prepared at all for the fact that her fiance would come to her with his wife. Meanwhile, no monitoring devices were needed to make sure that Jerry and Doni were the happiest of the newlyweds.

The woman "who was to become his wife" burst into tears, because although she was a woman of the XLVI century, nevertheless, firstly, the instinct of a woman still survived in her, and secondly, the sense of ownership was not completely eliminated. That's why she was crying.

When she stopped, Jerry outlined the individual moments in his love story in clear, clear terms.

Everyone present, including the woman "who was supposed to be his wife," was touched. It even seemed to them that the Council of World Reason should certainly forgive them, applying to their children all the scientific achievements of the last millennium to eliminate the consequences of the annoying dissimilarity of the potentials of parents.

Jerry, turning to the Servant of Public Safety, asked that everything that happened be brought to the attention of the Council of World Reason with a request for clemency.

The servant of Public Safety felt a criminal imbalance in his body - he was so shocked.

But he decided to stay in his post until the end. That's why he told Jerry and Doni:

Until further orders from the Council of World Reason, you will have to isolate yourself on the seashore. To do this, you will be provided with an aircraft of a close direction. Your request for clemency will be referred to the Council of World Reason. Come on!

Then, half an hour later, after sending Jerry and Doni to their place of seclusion, he told the Council of World Reason about everything that had happened. He ended his report with a request for his resignation, motivating her with a desire to rest and be treated at the Psychiatric Plant of Mankind. His request was respected. Thus ended his career as a Servant of Public Security 6C-D of the Russian Lowlands, who, by force of circumstances, lost confidence in the infallibility of the Council of World Reason.

### Chapter Six

In the XLVI century, all coastal strips of the globe were turned into wonderful tropical gardens. Thanks to artificially directed warm water and air currents, it was possible to instill an unprecedented flora in terms of luxury of colors and sizes. During the six non-working days of the week, people of the XLV1 century spent their time here in reasonable pleasures, not being connected with urban life in any way. On the seventh day, everyone usually hurried to the city, firstly, in order to ensure the welfare of mankind with their hour-long work, and secondly, to give an account of the past week by revealing their thoughts to the Rams apparatus. Thus, the gardens of the coast on this day became completely deserted. And since Jerry and Doni got here on the seventh day, they could quite enjoy the charm of solitude.

It can't be said that it was unpleasant for them.

On the contrary, completely absorbed in their feelings for each other, they found extraordinary pleasure walking through the fabulously beautiful garden, so harmoniously merging with their wonderful experiences. Wandering along the paths of golden gravel, under the shadow of giant flowers forming a swaying carpet of colors above their heads, intoxicated with each other and the scent of the surrounding air, they seemed to forget about everything that did not make sense in their present. Sometimes exchanging a few meaningless words, they found in the intonations of the speaker's voice the fullness of their happiness.

Only once did they see the shadow of a man at the end of the alley, who immediately disappeared at the sound of their footsteps. But this circumstance sobered them up to such an extent that they remembered the daily portion of food calories. Going to the nearest flower table, they took out one pill each and swallowed it in silence. After that, they almost simultaneously came up with the same idea. It seemed to them that the swallowed pills seemed to bring some kind of dissonance into the world of happiness, where they got into, wound up by love. And almost immediately both felt the watchful eye of the Council of World Reason upon them: this was already becoming unpleasant and creating some inevitable prospects in the future. Doni was a balanced woman in her own right, but under the influence of all that had happened, the sensitivity of perception that has been characteristic of all women since ancient times became acute in her. Therefore, she was the first to attack the idea of death. Only death can unite them forever. No Council of World Reason can then dissolve their marriage. Jhary, after thinking a little, quite agreed with Doni's opinion, finding it quite logical.

Thus, they came to the decision to die. But to die in the XLVI century, without the knowledge of the Council of World Reason, was not so easy.

One by one, they had to discard the supposed methods of self-mortification. In addition, they constantly had to take into account the fact of their stay in Coastal Recreation Gardens, where there were absolutely no tools of self-destruction.

Suddenly, Jerry, casually glancing at the sea, came up with an idea, obviously ridiculous, but which Doni, in the dazzle of marital obedience, found excellent. They decided to drown themselves.

Having climbed a fairly high hill overlooking the sea, they merged their mouths in the "eternal kiss of death", after which Jerry made a light leap forward and, clutching Doni in his arms, rushed down to meet the Desired death.

However, nothing terrible happened. The water, like liquid jelly, gently accepted their bodies, and then, having sprung out, left them to finish the "eternal kiss of death" on its surface.

Obeying the law of the variability of earthly phenomena, Jerry was eventually forced to tear himself away from Dona's lips. He felt like a terrible idiot in the most ancient sense of the word.

How could he forget that the water in all coastal strips was artificially compacted by the introduction of sealing gels. In the name of Public Safety! Soaked, but completely unharmed, they climbed ashore.

Both were embarrassed by their failure. The death wish took on nightmarish forms for both of them.

They - the free people of the XLVI century - felt themselves slaves to the laws of Inevitability!

After looking guiltily into each other's eyes, they decided to repeat the "kiss of death" they had begun on land. The kiss lasted an unusually long time, but still could not bring with it the desired death.

Then Doni, in whom, apparently, a woman of former times was waking up, suddenly acquired an unambiguous cunning. Leaning into Jerry's ear, she shared her plan with him. At first, Jerry thought this plan was a monstrous betrayal, but then, after thinking about it a lot, he came to the conclusion that it was only a "Great Sacrifice of Love." The plan was extraordinarily simple and consisted in cheating on each other with someone and thus earning death from the Council of World Reason. Under the existing laws of strictly reasonable monogamy, the punishment of death for such an offense was inevitable.

Jerry and Doni joined their mouths in a last farewell kiss and, courageously swallowing the tears that were coming, shook hands firmly, in the ancient way. And then, turning their backs to each other, they walked along the shore in opposite directions.

Suddenly, a terrible gust of wind knocked both of them off their feet and sprawled on the ground. Both of them felt as if they had been slammed down by something heavy. As soon as they were able to get to their feet, they rushed towards each other in a fit of burning anxiety.

But no. Both were completely unharmed, and the restored balance of the air sphere still threw a veil of its aromas over them. The nature around seemed invariably beautiful.

Jerry and Doni, repeating the kiss of farewell again, this time less confidently, went their separate ways again.

Walking along the shore, Jerry thought that their venture, after all, was not so easily feasible. As a last resort, they may have to resort to physical force. It will be especially difficult for Doni. And what will happen to them if one of them does his job and the other does not?

Full of doubts tormenting him, Jerry was slowly moving forward when he suddenly noticed something surprisingly strange.

A wide, dark strip ran far from the sea and, forming a semicircle, crashed into the shore, leaving a wide footprint on the sand and disappearing into the thicket of vegetation, as if encircling the place where Jerry and Doni were in an enchanted circle.

Approaching this dark strip crossing his path, Jerry thought that it was probably a moral warning to him from the Council of World Reason. He decided to leave an obstacle behind him in one leap. The jump was made, but it was not possible to jump over the barrier. Having hit some Invisible wall, Jerry was very indelicately thrown back. Getting to his feet and rubbing the bruised places, he was forced to come to the very sad conclusion that people of the XLVI century, although rare, still tend to experience physical pain.

Examining the surface of the invisible wall, he was convinced that it went high up, apparently forming a colossal transparent dome above them. It was already a very real expressed captivity!

Then Jerry thought of Doni, and he wanted to make sure as soon as possible that nothing bad had happened to her. Therefore, he ran as fast as he could back to where he had just come from, and was overjoyed at the sight of Doni hurrying towards him.

"Yes, she also came across a transparent smooth wall. No, she didn't jump. and that's why I only hurt myself a little bit."

Thus, Jerry and Doni comprehended the reality of the XLVI century captivity.

They did not have to wait long for further events.

A voice from a thousand miles away, amplified by a pitaphone, powerfully pronounced its verdict.

Since your attempt at a crime was so obvious that the crime can be considered already committed, the Council of World Reason decided to put you, Jerry, and you, Doni, to death by removing air from under the dome. If you don't like this method of strangulation for some reason, you can choose another death for yourself. But you will die under the dome. Five minutes to think.

Jhary and Doni exchanged happy glances. They have achieved their goal. Now death was inevitable.

Doni then took over the negotiations.

She proudly threw up:

We agree to die under the dome. We want to die in each other's arms. But don't deprive us of the air and its aromas. To this the voice replied:

Fine. Your wish will be fulfilled. A sweet sleeping poison will be injected into your dome. You will die from an excess of fragrance in the air. Death will be quick and pleasant. Get ready!

Some time later, falling asleep in eternal sleep and embracing each other, Jerry and Doni could hear words that no longer interested them:

Strange. You have the tastes of prehistoric people.

It was the Council of World Reason that concluded its observations on the Act of Unreasonable Death from Great Love.
