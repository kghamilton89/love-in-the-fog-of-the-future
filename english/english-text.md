### Chapter One

When Jerry stepped outside on that fated morning, he immediately understood that something with him wasn't quite right and it disturbed his usual peace of mind.

Upon the realization of this disturbance, Jerry began to become worried. Can you imagine it?

Worry was a state almost unknown to the People since the power of the Great Republic was concentrated into the hands of the Council of World Reason, which, having rebuilt life upon completely new principles, had achieved complete harmony between the internal and external states of mankind. Since the discovery of Ultraramsian Rays, which made it possible to photograph a person's most intimate thoughts, all impulses of the subconscious, the "I" of each individual, had been brought under complete control. The results of this event were colossal.

Criminals no longer existed, since crimes were discovered before they were committed, and humanity, freed from everything evil and illegal, intoxicated with brotherly love, enthusiastically devoted itself to fruitful work within the framework of self-improvement.

After just a few generations, the People reached the pinnacle of prosperity. A whole series of inventions of social innovations, wisely used, rendered earthly existence of the People to level of the biblical story of Genesis. Universal harmony reigned supreme. A detailed study of the subconscious, as belonging to the group and the individual, allowed for the creation of an objective truth, upon the foundation of which the "Laws of Objective Reason" were created. To meet their basic needs, people were required to work only one hour a week. And this work was, as it were, a continuation of that eternal holiday in which humanity was plunged. By this time, the fear of an idle existence, which so clearly characterized people of the past millennia, had been completely eliminated; humanity had perfected its expression of reasonable pleasure.

As such, Jerry was excited even if only vaguely aware of what was going to happen next. Five days ago, preparing to head to the Palace of Great Knowledge as he did today, Jerry suddenly found himself in an unusual position. As soon as he stepped onto the moving sidewalk, the slender figure of a young girl appeared on the platform of a neighboring house. Apparently in a hurry, she decided in one jump to leap over that part of the street that was moving in the opposite direction. The jump was full of an abundance of youthful vigot, but while her right foot was landed beside Jerry, her left slipped and touched the opposing strip of sidewalk. The girl would have inevitably fallen if Jerry had not grabbed her by the waist and placed her next to him. Freeing herself from his embrace, she threw him a grateful glance, and it was then that Jerry felt the first twinge of sweet excitement. They chatted happily the rest of the way.

"Her name is Doni. She is going to an exhibition of religious objects of people of the 20th and 21st centuries. There they will come to give her a small report. She was in a hurry. Would she get hurt? Oh, no! The road is so soft. Besides, accidents are completely excluded in the City of Reason. but still, she is very grateful to him. Thanks to his friendly help, she managed to save a few moments."

As the street upon which they were carrying on reached the Museum of Humanity, where Doni's exhibition was located, they nodded their heads to one another, and she extended her hand to him, thanking him with this gesture once again, and Gerry, taking it, shook it in a firm handshake, vaguely aware of the absurdity of this entire situation. This handshake in the 46th century seemed to throw them back into ancient times. After this exchange, they separated. Standing on the platform of the Palace of Great Knowledge, Jerry fell under the influence of one of the psycho-controlled boards scattered in large numbers throughout the city. Here he became convinced for the first time that his implementation was somewhat disrupted: the control apparatus, as he approached, instantly made a slight crackling sound. But the phenomenon was so fleeting that no one paid attention to it; even the Servant of Public Safety at his post simply limited himself to one searching glance towards Jerry.

After their first meeting, it somehow happened that they continued to meet each day. Jerry suddenly discovered in himself the greatest interest in all the details of religious fanaticism, the latest outbreak of which engulfed the people of the XXI century. Naturally, he could most readily get an answer to his requests in the Museum of Humanity, where he went daily each morning and where, under Doni's direct supervision, he comprehended the full horror of Christian penance, and examining the hood of any monastic order, he got a real idea of its complete dissimilarity with the epitrachelion in the vestments of a clergyman.

Thus passed four days.
